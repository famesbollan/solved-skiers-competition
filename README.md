Develop a C++ program to provide information regarding a recent downhill ski competition. Enter the names and times of the skiers and determine fasted speed, average speed, look up a skier’s time, and display the skiers’ names and times.

<table>

 <tbody>

  <tr>

   <td>Name</td>

   <td>Time</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td>Leela</td>

   <td>2.03</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td>Sarah</td>

   <td>2.40</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td>Anna</td>

   <td>1.85</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td>Keesha</td>

   <td>1.90</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td>Heidi</td>

   <td>2.50</td>

  </tr>

 </tbody>

</table>

Requirements:

<ul>

 <li>Use parallel arrays to store the skier names and times. Declare a global const SIZE = 5 to represent the size of the array. Declare the arrays inside the main program. Do NOT use global variables. The arrays must be passed to the functions as parameters.</li>

 <li>Variable names must be descriptive and initialized.</li>

 <li>Create a menu to ask the user if they want to

  <ul>

   <li>Determine the fastest skier</li>

   <li>Calculate the average time</li>

   <li>Find the time of a skier</li>

   <li>Display the skiers and their times</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Display the menu in the main program and then have functions for each of the menu items.</li>

 <li>The four functions will be

  <ul>

   <li>Display fastest skier</li>

   <li>Display average time</li>

   <li>Display skier’s time. In this function, flag if the user enters a name that is not in the list. Display a message to let the user know the name was not in the list.</li>

   <li>Display the skiers and their times</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Output must be labelled and easy to read as shown in the sample output below.</li>

 <li>Program must be documented with the following:

  <ul>

   <li>// Name</li>

   <li>// Date</li>

   <li>// Program Name</li>

   <li>// Description</li>

  </ul></li>

</ul>
